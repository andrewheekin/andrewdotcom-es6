  <h1>This website</h1>
  <p>The site is hosted with AWS S3 static hosting. The view is generated with react.js and
  webpack bundles all javascript. React-router provides simple
  routing functionality for the site. With the bundled javascript from webpack, updating the 
  site is as simple as uploading the new index.html, style, bundle.js, and img folder to the
  bucket.</p>
